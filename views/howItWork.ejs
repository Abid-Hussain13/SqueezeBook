      Welcome to <strong>BookSpace</strong> – your space to share, explore, and discover books with fellow readers.
      Here’s a quick overview of how everything works:
    </p>

    <hr class="mb-4">

    <h3 class="heading">1. Browse & Discover</h3>
    <p>
      On the <a href="/" class="bookLink">Explore Books</a> page, you’ll find a curated list of books made public by users.
      Use the <strong>search bar</strong> to find books by title or use the <strong>sort options</strong> (Title, Rating) to reorder them as you like.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading">2. Sign Up & Login</h3>
    <p>
      To contribute to the collection, simply <a href="/login" class="bookLink">log in</a> or <a href="/signup" class="bookLink">sign up</a>.
      Our sign-up form validates your inputs for safety and clarity — all done instantly in your browser.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading">3. Add Your Books</h3>
    <p>
      Once signed in, click on <a href="/add" class="bookLink">Add Book</a> from the main menu.
      Fill out the form with your book’s title, description, and optional rating.
      Your book will then appear in your personal collection.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading">4. Manage Your Collection</h3>
    <p>
      On your profile, you can view, update, or delete your books anytime.
      If you'd like to share them with the public, simply change the visibility status to <strong>public</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading">5. Seamless Experience</h3>
    <p>
      We’ve optimized the experience with features like:
      <ul>
        <li>Smart scroll memory — sorting/searching won’t disrupt your reading flow.</li>
        <li>Interactive navigation bar that stays with you.</li>
        <li>Validation to ensure secure and smooth form submissions.</li>
